ENCODE (ENCyclopedia Of Dna Elements) Transcription Factor Targets data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:  target genes of transcription factors from transcription factor binding site profiles

Measurement:  transcription factor DNA-binding by ChIP-seq

Association:   target gene-transcription factor associations by binding of transcription factor near 
                transcription start site of gene


There are three data files :

1. The file "gene_list_terms.txt" contains a list of 22449 in the data base

2. The file "attribute_list_entries.txt" contains the list of 181 transcription factors associated with the 22449 genes in the above list. 


3. The file "gene_attribute_edges.txt" contains 1651393 gene-transcription factor associations between the above 22449 genes and 181 transcription factors. We use this file for our protein-protein interaction
analysis.
